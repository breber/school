Readme

The purpose of this application is to process a PPM (P3) image and perform an 
operation on the image (in this case lightening each pixel). There will be
several implementations, and the goal is to see how each implementation performs
in terms of processor/memory/cache performance.

Below is a list of each implementation:

1. Contiguous memory storage (row order)
    * Load image into contiguous block of memory
    * Process the image in memory order (row order)
    * Write out the image
2. Contiguous memory storage (column order)
    * Load image into contiguous block of memory
    * Process the image in less ideal order (column order)
    * Write out the image
3. Pipeline Process (process and write pixel by pixel instead of reading in whole image first)
    * Read pixel from file
    * Process the pixel
    * Write out the pixel


TODO:
* List vs contiguous memory
* x by y, instead of single array
* Use int8 instead of int
