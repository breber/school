Programming Project 3
Spring 2012

-----------------
-- Building
-----------------

To build this project, run make from the src directory.

-----------------
-- Running
-----------------

To run this project, run:

	./match inputfile outputfile

Where inputfile is the path to a file in the specified format, 
and outputfile is the path that the matching results will be
written to. The output on the terminal will be the algorithm
runtime in seconds, as well as a reminder that the matching
results are in the specified path.

-----------------
-- Results
-----------------

I ran these tests on a Red Hat desktop with an Intel Xeon
CPU clocked at 3.30 GHz (a desktop in 1212 Coover).

Runtimes:

Case1: 0 seconds
Case2: .19 seconds
Case3: 2.72 seconds

These times include the actual runtime of the algorithm, not
including any file IO.
