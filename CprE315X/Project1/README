Project 1

Building:

To build the Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm executables, run the make command.

	make

This will create a file named 'prims' and a file named 'kruskals'.  These are the files
that will perform the algorithms.


Running:

The two programs read in the file from stdin (cin for C++).  Therefore the input needs 
to be fed into the program using file redirection on the command line.

	./prims < sparse1.txt

This will read in the file, execute the algorithm, and create an output.txt file in 
the same directory as the program is being executed from.  This output file will
be the minimum spanning tree in the same form as the input file (number of nodes, 
number of edges, list of edges).

The output in the terminal window will display the total weight of the minimum spanning
tree, as well as the runtime for the algorithm part of the execution.  This runtime does
not include the time spent reading the file, as that can be quite lengthy for the dense
graphs.


Testing Performance of Entire Process:

I have created a Python script that will execute both Prim's and Kruskal's on all 6 test
graphs we were given as a part of the assignment.  It will rename the output files to 
be more descriptive, and it will also output in the terminal window the runtime of the
entire execution process, including the time for reading the file.
