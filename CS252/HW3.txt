Question 1:

In order to get the hexadecimal encoding for the characters in my name, I ran the command:

echo "Brian Reber" | hexdump -C

The result is:

00000000  42 72 69 61 6e 20 52 65  62 65 72 0a              |Brian Reber.|
0000000c


Question 2:

The escape sequence in Ascii is "^[32m" which in hex is represented by 0x1b5b313b33326d.

Question 3:

The difference between DOS text files and UNIX text files is how they do perform newlines.  On DOS, a newline is represented by 0x0d followed by a 0x0a (ascii representation of a carriage return followed by a new line, aka line feed).  In UNIX, a newline is only represented by 0x0a (a new line character, aka line feed).
