<h2>Homework 5</h2>

<h3>Organization of the html page</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a folder hw5.Fall12<br/>
Download the hw5.Fall12.html file in that folder</li>
<li>
Create a subfolder aux under hw5.Fall12
<br/>Download the other html files in that folder</li>
</li>
<li>Create a subfolder css under hw5.Fall12
<br/>Download the css file for this assignment in this subfolder
/li>
<li>
Create a subfolder js under hw5.Fall12<br/>
Download the jQuery library and save it as jquery.js in this subfolder. 
You will also create a javascript file hw5.Fall12.js in this subfolder
and write your implementation for realizing the assignment
</li>

Now open the hw5.Fall12.html file in your browser. There are two
components that constructs the html page:
<ul>
<li>hw5.Fall12.html: contains the contents that you view on the page</li>
<li>hw5.Fall12.css: constains the styling elements that are used in the hw5.Fall12.html</li>
</ul>
The CSS style is used to organize the contents of the html page in four groups:
header (at the top), footer (in the bottom), leftnavigation (in the left) and 
content (in the middle). 


<h4>Specification of html list elements</h4>

In the html page, the list elements are written based on the following specifications.

<li>
Top-level list has the id <tt>dmenu</tt>
</li>

<li>
Every top-level list item name must start with "__"
</li>

<li>
The top-level list items contains second-level list, which is
an un-ordered list with class value <tt>menuitems</tt>
</li>

<li>
For each second-level list item there is file &lt;filename&gt;.html
such that the text element associated with the list item is identical
to the filename. For instance, for the second level list item
FindExisting there is a FindExisting.html.
</li>
</ol>
Review the given hw5.Fall12.html file to better understand the above
specification.

<h4>Your Assignment</h4> Assume that x.html is the html file which
includes your hw5.Fall12.js javascript file and contains a two-level
list element as per the above specification.  You are required to
write javascript functions in the <tt>hw5.Fall12.js</tt> such that the
following dynamics are realized in x.html (for your assignment, we have
provided one such x.html in the form of hw5.Fall12.html):<br/>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Intialize</b>: When the x.html is loaded, a pop-up window stating "Hello! I am &lt;yournetid&gt;"
should show up, and  only the top-level list items should be visible
</li>

<li>
<b>Expand</b>: Clicking on a top-level list item makes the second level list items visible.
Nothing else in view of the x.html should change. 
</li>

<li>
<b>Collapse</b>: Clicking on a already expanded top-level list item makes its
second level list items invisible. Nothing else in the  view of the x.html should change. 
</li>

<li>
<b>Explore</b>: Clicking on a second level list item will open the corresponding html page
in the section identified by "id=content" in the x.html page.
</li>


</ol>

<font color="red" style="text-transform:uppercase"><b>Do not update the given html 
and css files.</b></font>
