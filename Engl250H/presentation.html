    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>When I thought about this presentation, I had mixed feelings.
    Really, this presentation was not supposed to be that long; only about
    three minutes long.  While three minutes may feel like a long time when
    presenting, it really isn't.  I started planning my presentation, and
    figured I had plenty of information.  When I went in for my conference,
    I had some general ideas of what I wanted to talk about, and then after
    I talked with Professor Payne and cleared up my ideas, I was able to 
    create an outline.
    </p>
    <div style="float:left; padding-right:15px; padding-bottom:15px;">
    <embed src="videos/reber_presentation.m4v" height="256" width="320" 
        autoplay="false" type="video/quicktime" 
        pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" scale="tofit"></div>
    <p>After I created that outline, I didn't look at it until the day 
    before I presented.  Then I looked at it, went through it in my head
    a bunch of times, and felt I was ready.  What made this presentation
    easy for me was that I knew the event well, and could talk about it
    easily.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Rhetorical Analysis of the Presentation</h3>
    <p>I think that this presentation is much better than my baseline
    presentation in terms of rhetorical structure.  There is much more
    substance to it, and the organization is much more logical.  The reason
    for this is that I prepared more than I did for the baseline 
    presentation and I knew what I was going to say.  I put a lot more 
    thought into it, and this helped tremendously.  Not only with the 
    content, but also with my nerves.  I felt much more relaxed in the final
    presentation than I did with the baseline.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of rhetorical analysis, my presentation was organized in 
    a chronological order.  This is what made the most sense with my
    event.  I started out at the beginning of the day, and followed the
    Rosemount High School Marching Band around as they warmed up and 
    performed.  This chronological organization not only made sense, it also
    made it much easier to remember and recite.
    </p>
    <p>In this presentation, I used both verbal and nonverbal delivery
    techniques.  This combination allowed there to be some variety, and
    made it less like a lecture and more informal.  I felt that it was very 
    informal espeically because it was in front of a small group, which 
    made it easier to connect with the audience.  Also the use of gestures
    such as pointing to certain parts of the poster helped engage the 
    audience.
