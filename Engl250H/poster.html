    <h3>Poster Revisions</h3>

    <p>This is one of the first designs of my poster.  I had some drafts
    that preceded this one, but this is what I brought in to my conference
    with Professor Payne.  Looking back on this version, there are a lot of
    design issues that are distracting.  One of the main problems is the 
    dark lettering in the title overlaying the dark background.  This is
    pretty difficult to read.  To fix this I lowered the opacity on the 
    background, and inverted the colors on the letters.  This alone made 
    it look much neater.    
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the title, I added a couple more statistics in the
    right box, and then adjusted the spacing so that it wasn't as cramped.
    I aligned the bottom-center picture with the rest of the bottom boxes.
    There were a lot of minor changes, which all led up to the final draft.
    These many small changes made a huge difference.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Rhetorical Analysis of Visual Communication</h3>

    <div style="float:left; margin-right:15px;">
    <a href="images/reber_poster_final.jpg">
    <img src="images/reber_poster_final.jpg" alt="Final Poster Design" 
        title="Final Poster Design" class="posterpics"/>
    </a></div>
    <p>The purpose of this poster is to communicate information about
    the Youth in Music Champoinships.  What makes this poster successful
    is its use of the different rhetorical techniques that make objects
    visually attractive.  One technique used is a grid.  There are six main
    sections of this poster.  Each section contains either an image or text.
    This makes it easy for the viewer to group similar information and this
    leads to the directionality provided in the poster.  This poster has 
    rotational directionality originating at the bottom-center.  The 
    pictures on top are rotated to match the angle from the bottom-center 
    image.
    </p>
    
    <p>This poster also contains a contrast between the background and 
    foreground.  In the background, there is a faded image of a ground of
    students marching.  In the foreground, we see the prominent images, as
    well as all of the text.  I felt that having an image in the background
    would make more sense than having a solid color.  By lowering the 
    opacity we are able to still see it, but it is not overpowering.
    </p>
    
    <p>Also, the colors that are used throughout the poster are similar, 
    and are kept to a few select colors so as not to be distracting.  I use
    the grayish background color in the text boxes, and then the text is the
    purple that is used in the color guard uniform.  In the first section on
    this page, I talked about my choices in the color of the title text.
