            <h2 class="title">Visual Reflection</h2> 

            <p>I have always thought pictures and photography were interesting.  When I was
            younger my sister was really into figure skating, and I would go to most of her
            competitions and help my parents take pictures.  I really enjoyed doing that.
            Also, in my marching band it was tradition for each section to have its own t-shirt.
            My junior and senior year I designed them with some help from others.  To do this, 
            I used photoshop to edit some pictures and add effects and get the colors down enough
            so that it would be inexpensive enough to put on a shirt.  I really enjoyed that as well.</p>
            
            <p>When I was working on the visual baseline assignment, I had many thoughts about what
            I wanted to photograph, and how to do it.  I didn't have much time, so I figured that I would
            be using the camera on my phone.  I knew that it was able to take quality pictures at a
            resolution of up to 1280x960.  My only problem was that the camera on the phone only worked
            well in decently lit situations, which eliminated my ideas about dawn pictures.  Later I 
            found the monument for the first computer bug on the west side of Coover, and decided to
            take a picture of it in the morning.  I am pretty pleased with how that turned out. </p>

            <p>To the left is one of my postcards that we made to learn about Photoshop.  I used
            a radial background gradient to surround the apple, and I played around with the 3D
            transformations that Photoshop CS4 introduced.  I think that it was a good way to 
            introduce us to Photoshop, but I am still not quite pleased with the design of this postcard.
            </p>
            
            <p>Later when we were told to design a poster using pictures and information, I figured
            that it wouldn't be too difficult to use Photoshop.  I knew that technically I could
            put this poster together, but I wasn't sure what sort of design I wanted.  I am not very
            creative, so designing the poster was the difficult part and putting it together in
            Photoshop was the easy part.</p>
            
            <p>Through this class, I have learned a lot about what is visually effective, and this
            helped in the design process.  Instead of randomly placing pictures around the page, I 
            used a basic grid pattern, with radial motion depicted.  The title was big, but I think
            that was a good choice because it easily catches the eye.  Comparing my first and final 
            drafts is an eye-opening experience.  There are many things that I am glad I changed for
            my final draft because it looks much more professional and pleasing. </p>
