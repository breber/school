            <h2 class="title">Self Assessment</h2> 

            <p>Overall, I think I am a successful communicator.  I am able to get the job
            done, and oftentimes add some style to my communication.  As it can be expected,
            some areas of communication are stronger than others, and some I am more confident
            with.</p>
            
            <p>To Recap:
            
            <ul>
            <li>Written:  I don't necessarily enjoy writing, but I think I am good at it.  I 
            am able to put down what I want, and for the most part it makes sense, and gets
            my point across.
            </li><br />
            <li>Oral:  This is probably my weakest mode of communication.  I am a fairly quiet
            person, and I don't like public speaking much.  I am not the type that can come up
            with ideas off the top of my head; I need to think about it and write it down ahead
            of time.  Once I know what I am going to say and practice it, I can present it without
            looking nervous (even though I am on the inside).
            </li><br />
            <li>Visual:  I am not a very creative person, so coming up with visual designs is not
            my strong suit.  Once I finally do come up with a design, it is usually no problem to
            implement it.  I am a technical type of person, so the design is the difficult part, and
            putting it together is the easier part.
            </li><br />
            <li>Electronic:  In my opinion, this is my strongest mode of communication.  I have grown
            up loving technology, and this has greatly increased my ability to communicate through it.
            I find that the mode that you enjoy most is the one that becomes the strongest.  I think
            electronic communication is what I enjoy most because of the technical nature of it; it 
            makes sense to me.  Comparing this to visual communcation which uses a lot of creativity
            which is not what I am good at.
            </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>To improve on my communication skills, I plan on continuing to analyze what I do, and
            try to come up with conclusions based off of that.  I will continue to work at the weaker
            modes, which will hopefully make them stronger.  I don't think I will ever like the oral
            mode very much, but I think that learning to be a good speaker is important in the business
            world.  I even noticed this at my internship this past summer - I needed to share what I had
            done on the project in a conference call with my boss as well as other senior software
            engineers.  It was intimidating, but a great learning experience.</p>
            
            <p>Another way to improve is to "put yourself out there."  This can be quite a challenge
            for someone like me, but it is the only way you will learn.  Getting constructive criticism
            on your work may not be fun, but it too is an important step in the communication world.</p>
