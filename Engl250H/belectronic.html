    <h3>The Making of the Video</h3>
    <p>I didn't think this assignment would be that difficult, because I greatly enjoy 
    using technology.  I found it to be somewhat difficult actually.  First off, I didn't
    have a decent video camera.  I tried taking video on my cell phone, but that video was
    of poor quality.  I then decided to take still pictures and stitch them together like
    a slideshow, and add some background music.  This was the extent of my difficulties
    with the technology aspect.</p>
    <p>I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to film/depict.  I knew of some great 
    places around campus, and I had some pretty good pictures of these places.  My next
    problem was that I had too many pictures to fit in a 30 second time slot, so I had to 
    go through and choose the best pictures for the final cut.  So the content wasn't the
    hard part, it was just trying to put it together in a good way.<br /><br /></p>
    
    <h3>Rhetorical Analysis</h3>
    <p>Being that this video could only be about 30 seconds, it was difficult to incorporate
    a lot of the rhetorical devices mentioned in the student guide.  In any case, I will tell
    you about the devices that were used.  Firstly, the whole movie can be considered a 
    database of my experiences in my first week or two here at Iowa State.  This database
    helps classify my experiences by what was important enough for me to not only take a 
    picture, but to also include it.  As I said a few paragraphs ago, I had more pictures
    than I had time for in the video, and therefore the ones included are the most important.</p>
    
    <p>Another technique used in this video is layering.  There are both visual layers as well as
    audio layers.  All of the visual objects are layered on top of the music I selected.  Having
    a video with no sounds or no visual elements would not be very effective.  So I chose a song 
    that I felt embodied my feelings, and added the most important pictures on top of it.  In 
    addition to the visuals layered on top of the audio, there are also visual layers on top of
    other visual layers.  For instance the text that is layered on top of the pictures.  The order
    of the layers makes a big difference.  For example, having the picture on top of the words
    would be very ineffective given that the words would not be seen.</p>
    
    <p>Another important element is the transformations.  The pictures transform in and out of
    view, making it more interesting for the viewer.  I think that transformations in and out
    are important.  One example that I can think of right away is powerpoint presentations.  I
    have noticed that teachers' powerpoints are much more interesting when there are transformations
    in them instead of the default slide to slide effect.  This is why I decided to use them.</p>
