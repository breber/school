    Within this box, I have embedded my written baseline activity.  This assignment was about what we as
    freshmen at ISU need to do to be successful. In general, I think that this piece of writing was decent.
      
    
    <div class="excerpt">
    <p>I believe that in order for me to succeed in college, I must set a plan regarding 
    how I will get all my work accomplished, as well as how much I am going to challenge myself. 
    Time management is a vital skill necessary for success in college.  I will use my electronic 
    calendar and task management program to keep track of my class schedule and homework assignments.</p>
    
    <p>I think it is also necessary to push oneself outside of their comfort zone.  This semester, 
    I am taking 19.5 credits including band.  This leads to a very busy schedule and a headache to 
    manage what needs to be accomplished when.  Staying organized is necessary to succeed.  I am 
    also taking Calculus 3 with a professor who is hard to understand.  This has challenged me to 
    figure try and learn what I don't understand on my own.</p>
    
    <p>Taking challenging classes is also important in success.  Although it may be risky to my 
    GPA or self-esteem, it will make me a better student and a more learned person.  Those that 
    don't take risks will not gain anything.  If I were to take only classes that were easy, I wouldn't 
    be learning anything, which is not the goal of college.</p>
    
    <p>Finding a quiet place to study will help me accelerate my learning.  If I am surrounded by 
    televisions, games and other people I will not get anything accomplished.  Finding that perfect 
    place where all my focus will be on my homework will greatly increase my focus and understanding. </p>
