    <h2 class="title">Written Baseline</h2> 

    Within this box, I have embedded my written baseline activity. 
    This assignment was about what we as freshmen at ISU need to do to be 
    successful. Being the first writing assignment after summer vacation, 
    it is a little rough, but I think that it gets the point across.
    <br />  
    
    <div class="excerpt">
    <p>I believe that in order for me to succeed in college, I must set a plan regarding 
    how I will get all my work accomplished, as well as how much I am going to challenge myself. 
    Time management is a vital skill necessary for success in college.  I will use my electronic 
    calendar and task management program to keep track of my class schedule and homework assignments.</p>
    
    <p>I think it is also necessary to push oneself outside of their comfort zone.  This semester, 
    I am taking 19.5 credits including band.  This leads to a very busy schedule and a headache to 
    manage what needs to be accomplished when.  Staying organized is necessary to succeed.  I am 
    also taking Calculus 3 with a professor who is hard to understand.  This has challenged me to 
    figure try and learn what I don't understand on my own.</p>
    
    <p>Taking challenging classes is also important in success.  Although it may be risky to my 
    GPA or self-esteem, it will make me a better student and a more learned person.  Those that 
    don't take risks will not gain anything.  If I were to take only classes that were easy, I wouldn't 
    be learning anything, which is not the goal of college.</p>
    
    <p>Finding a quiet place to study will help me accelerate my learning.  If I am surrounded by 
    televisions, games and other people I will not get anything accomplished.  Finding that perfect 
    place where all my focus will be on my homework will greatly increase my focus and understanding. </p>
