    <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
    <p>One of our first assignments was to write a paper about a place.  I decided to write my paper about the Parks Library.  To do this paper, we needed to visit and document the place we chose to research.  I went to the library one afternoon, and collected a bunch of pictures that I thought did a good job at portraying the unique atmosphere that the library provides.  I also tried to get some pictures that show the interesting and appealing arcitecture of the building.  Here is a collection of pictures that I used for my place paper.</p>

        <h3>The Revision</h3>
        <p>This paper was our first major paper of the semester, and I don't think it was one of my better papers.
        This is why I decided to revise it.  I looked at the comments Professor Payne gave me, and I went through
        and made those changes.  Along with that, I added a couple of paragraphs that added a better counter-argument
        so that my initial argument would therefore be strengthened.</p>
        <p>There were a lot of little things that I changed in my revision.  Some of them included mechanical/technical
        changes such as changing the title to a Sans-Serif font, and adding captions.  In my previous edition I had
        captions on my pictures, but they only seemed to work on Windows.  So this time I figured out how to add the
        captions on my Mac.  Another change I implemented was changing the pace of my writing.  In the original
        draft it was too slow; I spelled out too many obvious ideas.  In the revision I took out the obvious
        statements, and revised it to have varying sentence lengths and styles.</p>
        
        <h3>Rhetorical Analysis</h3>
        <p>In making this paper, I chose a thesis statement that I felt I could back up and feel comfortable writing
        about.  The thesis is an important part of the essay, and making sure that you believe in it is vital in
        creating a well-written paper.  If you don't belive in your thesis, your writing will sound uninterested
        and the reader will be able to tell.  In addition to the thesis, I tried to vary my sentences to keep interest
        high in the paper.  This is one of the many things I added in my revision.  I now understand that the variation
        helps keep the reader interested, which is important.</p>
        <p>The document is organized in such a way that the paragraphs are pretty evenly spaced, and the pictures are
        placed at logical points in the paragraph.  I also tried to put them on different sides of the paper so that
        it wouldn't look like one side was more picture-heavy than another.  This is one thing that bothers me a lot
        is when spacing isn't correct, or the spacing tends towards one side more than another.  So I was sure to be
        careful with the placement of the images.</p>
