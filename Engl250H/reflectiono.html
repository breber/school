            <p>As with the majority of the population, public speaking is definitely not one
            of my favorite things to do.  As with writing, I think that if I try to eliminate
            my nervousness, I can do a pretty good job at it.  I have noticed a drastic change
            in my public speaking abilities in this class.  I have a few ideas as to what may
            have influenced the change.</p>
            
            <p>First of all, let me talk a little bit about my speaking habits.  I have been told
            that I have a great speaking voice, even though I am a fairly shy person.  When I 
            speak I get nervous, but I don't think my voice really shows I am nervous.  What 
            I really notice when I am speaking is that my legs shake, and I will oftentimes
            sway to keep myself from putting too much stress on one leg.  Another tendency I have
            is that I don't really know what to do with my hands.  I would like to keep them in my
            pockets, but this probably isn't appropriate for a speech.  Professor Payne suggests to
            use gestures, but this doesn't really come naturally to me.  Although it doesn't
            necessarily come naturally, I noticed when I do it, I am able to remember  more and 
            the speech comes more naturally. </p>
            
            <p>My baseline speech was not a very good speech, and I guess that is to be expected.
            But I noticed myself becoming a lot more comforatble with my small group, and sharing
            with them was a lot easier.  In the full class setting I still noticed that it was
            easier to present because I felt I was getting to know them more.  I think this was
            the major piece that made my poster presentation go well.  Also, presenting in to the
            smaller groups in a somewhat informal setting also helped.</p>
            
            <p>I am not the type of person that can make things up on the spot - at least not 
            very well.  This means that I need to write down my ideas, and practice it.  While I
            don't like practicing, I know that it makes my speeches more coherent.  For the
            baseline speech I didn't really practice at all.  On the other hand, for the poster
            presentation I did more practicing - even going through it in my head the night before
            helped a lot.</p>
            
            <p>I feel that I have grown as a speaker throughout this class.  This doesn't mean that
            I like it any more than I did entering the class.  It just means that I am able to feel
            a bit more comfortable doing it, and this itself will help tremendously.</p>
