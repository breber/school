            <h2 class="title">Multimodal Reflection</h2> 

            <p>In today's society, it is almost impossible to create a piece that is
            strictly one mode.  Almost all of our projects could be considered
            multimodal, but the one that is the clear winner is the ePortfolio itself.
            Before this class, I didn't really think about how I received information.
            I now realize that there are four main types: written, oral, visual, and 
            electronic.  I also learned that these can be combined to make communication
            even more effective.  Although in some cases I think using too many modes can
            decrease effectiveness and become distracting.  For example, if on this page
            I had a video set to automatically play, background music playing, lots of 
            colors scattering the page, and words in different sizes and fonts, this would
            become very distracting.  This is where a minimalist approach may work best.
            </p>
            
            <p>Throughout this class, I have come to notice the importance of using
            multiple modes.  Let me bring you back to the example I used in another 
            reflection, a teacher's powerpoint presentation.  If a teacher just stood still
            in front of the class and used no visual aides, and talked in a monotone voice,
            would you find it interesting?  I think that more than half the class would
            be sleeping.  Although if they use some visual aides, such as a powerpoint, or
            even a sample experiment, more of the class will be awake.</p>
            
            <p>This ePortfolio has taken a long time to create, and this is because I need
            to connect all of the different projects together.  Multiple modes were used
            in different projects, and putting them all together and analyzing how I put
            them together is no easy task.  While it may not be easy, it is a great 
            learning experience and I feel that it has made me look deeper into the work
            that I did, therefore making me understand how I do things better.  This 
            understanding is what will make me a better communicator later in life.</p>
