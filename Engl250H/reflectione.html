            <h2 class="title">Electronic Reflection</h2> 

            <p>Coming into this class, I felt that electronic communication was probably my
            strongest form.  I have always loved technology, and I am currently studying to be 
            a computer engineer.  When you think about it, electronic communication has a wide
            spread definition - it can mean anything from texting to making a website, or even
            making our posters is electronic communication because we created it on the computer.
            This class has taught me more effective ways to communicate through electronic mediums.
            </p>
            
            <p>I have started to notice different forms of electronic communication in my daily life,
            and I analyze it.  I think to myself about the effectiveness of different advertisements
             - such as the spacing of elements, sizing of text, text width, etc.  I think one of the
            most educational activities we did was discussing CSS with our small groups, and then
            eventually playing around with it.  The best way to learn about the effective types of
            communication is to try them all out.  I learned a lot about CSS and HTML through just
            trying things and seeing what worked and what didn't.</p>
            
            <p>I had learned a a fair amount about CSS and JavaScript through a summer internship
            I had this past summer.  Most of my knowledge was learned through experimentation.
            But I feel that I learned a lot from reading the textbook, and "officially" learning
            CSS.  I feel that when you learn something on your own, your knowledge isn't as full
            as it is when someone officially teaches you, or when you learn from a textbook.</p>
            
            <p>To recap, I feel that I learned a great deal from talking with others, and through
            reading the textbook and "officially" learning about the specified topics.</p>
