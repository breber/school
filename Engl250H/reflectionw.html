            <h2 class="title">Written Reflection</h2> 

            <p>When one thinks of a typical English class, they normally think about
            reading books and writing papers.  Written communication has historically
            been one of the most prominant forms of communication.  In English 250H PB
            we wrote two main papers, and worked in groups to write reflections on 
            in-class activites.  I feel that I have learned a lot about myself as a 
            writer, and I think that I am able to improve on my writing by taking this
            new knowledge and applying it to my typical day's writings. </p>

            <p>Writing is not something that I enjoy doing, but I think that if I put my
            mind to it, my final product will be great.  The type of writing we did this
            semester was more interesting to me than the writing I remember doing in high
            school English classes.  This semester we were able to write about an interesting
            place of our choice.  Being able to use multiple forms of communication (written, 
            and visual being the main two) made the experience more enjoyable.  The other major
            paper we wrote was analyzing a documentary.  I watched <i>Supersize Me</i>, a movie
            I had seen parts of before.  Getting the chance to watch it fully and with more
            concentration focused on it was a great learning experience.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the things I noticed about my writing this semester is that I used
            the same sentence structure a lot.  My writing wasn't varied much.  This makes the
            writing less interesting for the reader, therefore lessening the communication that
            occurs.  If you look at my revision of my place paper, you will notice that I tried
            to eliminate unnecessary sections, vary my sentence structure, and add more of a
            counter-argument that will therefore strengthen my original argument.</p>
