### Career Objective

Upon graduating in May 2013, I plan to begin working full-time in the field of Computer/Software Engineering. I have a strong interest in software development for mobile platforms. My interest in mobile platforms stems from the fact that people are always on the go, and being able to have information always at their fingertips is crucial.

Another interest of mine is embedded software. This goes hand in hand with my interest in mobile software, because in order to have a mobile device, an embedded system is needed. Being able to write software that efficiently uses the resources on an embedded system interests me.
