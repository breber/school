 * the upper left corner of the bounding square. The position is represented
 * by an instance of java.awt.Point.  The initial position is presumed to be 
 * given by a constructor; thereafter it can be modified by the shiftX()
 * and shiftY() methods.  Note that no bounds checking is done in 
 * implementations of this interface; therefore, the position can have 
 * negative coordinates.
