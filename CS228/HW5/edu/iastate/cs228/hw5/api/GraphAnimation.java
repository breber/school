/**
 * Interface for traversal and path-finding algorithms to be
 * displayed by animated graph visualization tools.  The algorithm
 * is assumed to be of the following general form
 * 
 * <code>
 * add start vertex to open set
 * while open set is not empty
 *     remove a vertex u from open set
 *     add u to closed set
 *     if u is the goal vertex
 *         done = true
 *         break
 *     for each neighbor v of u
 *         if v is not in open set or closed set
 *             add v to open set
 *             record u as the predecessor of v
 * done = true
 * </code>
 * 
 * One "step" (for the purposes of the step() method below) consists 
 * essentially of one execution of the while loop body.  The general
 * usage of a GraphAnimation instance thus has the form:
 * <code>
 * while not done()
 *     step()
 * </code>
 *
