/**
 * Abstract factory for creation of GraphAnimation instances.  An 
 * implementation of GraphAnimation can be used to perform a single
 * traversal or search of a given graph.  Between steps of the search,
 * and after the algorithm has finished, the object can be queried 
 * regarding paths and distances to vertices.  Here is an example 
 * of running a shortest-path algorithm for nodes in a graph
 * of Foo objects, given a particular starting vertex:
 * 
 * <code>
 *    PathFinderFactory factory = ... // obtain an instance of a factory
 *    Graph<Foo> g = ...              // create the graph
 *    Foo start = ...                 // choose starting point
 *    GraphAnimation<Foo> finder = factory.createDijkstraFinder(g, start, null);
 *    while (!finder.done())
 *    {
 *      Foo vertex = finder.step();
 *      System.out.println(vertex.toString() + " added to closed set");
 *    }
 *    Foo v = ...                     // a vertex to query about
 *    List<Foo> path = finder.getPath(v);
 *    System.out.println(v.toString() + " path: " + path.toString());
 * </code>
