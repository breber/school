## General Education Reflection

The General Education component of my engineering curriculum has given me insight into the different cultures and politics of the world. By having an understanding of these different cultures, students will be able to better communicate with coworkers, clients and any other people we encounter in the global technology market.

I had the opportunity to take a number of general education courses during my four years at Iowa State, dealing with both American and global issues. One of the courses I took that has the most direct impact on my interests was eDemocracy. This course detailed how technology and government are both working together and against each other in our modern societies. The technologies I have the potential to build as an engineer can be used to optimize common tasks in society if it is implemented and used properly. This same technology is also able to be used to wreak havoc in a society if it is used improperly or in a way that is harmful to others. This course opened my eyes to this possibility, and will have an impact on how I work on both designing and implementing new technologies.

The other courses in my general education component serve to introduce me to other cultures. They not only introduce me to other nationalities, but also to other religions. All of these courses will make my experience working in industry go more smoothly and efficiently.

I feel that through my general education courses, I will be a more productive and knowledgable person. This will help in any endeavor I choose to pursue.
