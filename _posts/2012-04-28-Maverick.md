## Maverick Software Consulting - August 2010 - April 2012

During the school years from August 2010 through April 2012, I worked at Maverick Software Consulting in Ames, IA. I worked on the Document team for the WestlawNext product at Thomson Reuters.

I continued the work I did at Thomson Reuters the summer of 2010 throughout the school year. Through this experience, I learned invaluable communication skills because of the fact I was working on a software development team based in Eagan, MN. I communicated with the members of the team mainly through email and instant messaging. I also learned how to take initiative and get work accomplished without having someone always there to tell you what needs to be done. During my time at Maverick, I was involved in fixing over 100 bugs in the Document codebase, and worked on over 30 user stories.

Through this project, I was able to gain professional experience using XSLT, JavaScript, C#, and working remotely.
