## CS 309
### Software Development Practices

In Computer Science 309, I worked in a group with three other Computer Engineers to take a project idea from concept through implementation. The only project restriction was that it needed to be complex enough and have enough for everyone in the group to work on for the entire semester.

My team was interested in creating an Android app. After much thought, we decided to make a multiplayer/multidevice card game application for the Android platform. The general idea was that there would be a tablet that would be the "gameboard" for the game, keeping track of the game state and whose turn it was, and then each player would connect to the tablet with their own Android device which would then show them their hand.

Since the team didn't have a lot of experience in Android development, we figured that this would be a pretty challenging project to complete. For the first part of the semester, we worked on design documents to try and get a handle on how everything would be built and how it would all work together. We also took this time to familiarize ourselves with the Android platform and come up with a proof of concept. This proof of concept was to prove that we would be able to connect multiple devices together through Bluetooth and sustain the connection through the entire game play. The networking was the part of the design that we were the most unsure about, since none of us had any network programming experience.

A major part of this course was design documentation. The majority of the semester was to come up with this documentation. We followed the IEEE standard for the Software Requirements Specification, and developed numerous use-cases for our project. Below are the screen flow diagrams we developed for the gameboard and the player users.

By the end of the semester we had developed a working and exciting game that we had the opportunity to demonstrate to the class. The class enjoyed seeing our finished product, and voted our project best project!

Our app is now published on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.worthwhilegames.cardgames)!

Some of the resources we used include:

* Android SDK
* Sample projects included in the Android SDK
* Stack Overflow
