## CprE 288
### Embedded Systems I: Introduction

Professor: Dr. Akhilesh Tyagi

Embedded C programming. Interrupt handling. Memory mapped I/O in the context of an application. Elementary embedded design flow/methodology. Timers, scheduling, resource allocation, optimization, state machine based controllers, real time constraints within the context of an application. Applications laboratory exercises with embedded devices.

In Computer Engineering 288, we worked on a number of labs involving a modified iRobot (Roomba Robot). We wrote C code that controlled the many sensors on this robot including an IR sensor, a Sonar sensor, a bump sensor and a drop sensor. We also were able to control a number of servos that would reposition some of these sensors. Logic was also written to make the robot drive around and avoid obstacles.

The final project for CprE288 was to write combine all of the features from the previous labs in order to make the robot navigate through an obstacle course to a final destination. We were in a group of four, and we were able to combine the code reasonably easily. The hard part was taking the data that was being live-streamed from the robot and analyzing it. When we were trying to navigate the robot through the course, we were not able to look at where it was. We had to rely on the data the sensors gave us in order to make decisions as to where to go next.

To help with this process, I developed a Java Swing GUI that would act as a map for us. We would be able to draw objects on this map when the data indicated there was an obstacle, and then use this map to guide our decisions.

Below is an image of the map we ended up with during our demo:
