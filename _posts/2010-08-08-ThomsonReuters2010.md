## Thomson Reuters - Summer 2010

During the summer of 2010, I worked at Thomson Reuters in Eagan, MN. I worked on the Document team, for the WestlawNext product.

During this summer, I worked as a regular developer on the agile team. I wasn't given a special intern project, but was working on the same stories and bugs that the full time developers were working on. I became the go-to person for the content related stories - I was responsible for adding support for new types of documents on the website. This responsibility was very important to bringing up the WestlawNext support to the level of the previous edition of the website, Westlaw. I worked directly with a number of the other Software Engineers on the team, as well as with the Product Developers/Business people pushing the project forward.

Through this project, I was able to gain professional experience using XSLT, JavaScript, C#, agile development techniques, and Team Foundation Server (TFS).
