## Thomson Reuters - Summer 2009

During the summer of 2009, I worked at Thomson Reuters in Eagan, MN as a High School Software Engineer Intern. I worked on a small team in the Westlaw Business division.

I worked on two major projects during this summer. The first was to multithread an internal testing utility. The utility performed testing operations on the UI thread, so while tests were being performed, the user interface was completely unusable. My job was to take all of the processing and move it to a separate thread. This background thread then communicated both logging messages and progress with the UI thread so that the tester could see the progress as well as the output from the processing.

The second project I worked on was to help build a Microsoft Word plugin that would allow legal researchers to annotate documents, and perform legal research from within Microsoft Word. The plugin was mainly written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I played a major role in the CSS of the document, and developed a number of features in the JavaScript of the application.

Through this project, I was able to gain professional experience using JavaScript and C#. I also gained valuable experience by working with a Senior Software Engineer mentor.
