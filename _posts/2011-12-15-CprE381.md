## CprE 381
### Computer Organization and Assembly Level Programming

Professor: Dr. Joseph Zambreno

Introduction to computer organization, evaluating performance of computer systems, instruction set design. Assembly level programming: arithmetic operations, control flow instructions, procedure calls, stack management. Processor design. Datapath and control, scalar pipelines, introduction to memory and I/O systems.

In Computer Engineering 381, we worked in groups to design, implement and test both a single-cycle processor and a 5 stage pipelined processor in VHDL. They were both based on the MIPS architecture.

My role on my team of three Computer Engineers was mainly the overall design of our processor, as well as writing the MIPS assembly code to test our processor. Some of the major features I worked on included:

* Writing Merge-Sort in MIPS assembly
* Converting byte-addressable memory to word-addressable memory
* Designing the overall layout of the processor
* Helping develop/implement the forwarding and hazard detection logic
* Thoroughly testing and debugging the overall design
* Designed the instruction fetch module

Below is an image of our overall design of the 5-stage pipelined processor:

Software/Languages Used:

* VHDL
* MIPS assembly
* ModelSIM
* MARS (Mips Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
