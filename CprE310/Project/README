Compiling PageRank
---------------------------------------------------------------
For your convenience, I have included a runnable Jar file with
my submission.  Therefore, no compilation is necessary to run
my code.  If you would like to compile it, though, follow the
following steps.

-Navigate to the src directory in my submission.
-Run the following command to compile the code
	
	javac pagerank/*.java
	
This will compile all the java files necessary

---------------------------------------------------------------
Running PageRank
---------------------------------------------------------------
To run the precompiled Jar file, navigate to the base directory
of my submission in the command line, and run

	java -jar PageRank.jar -f inputfile.txt
	
where inputfile.txt is replaced with the actual file name of the
input file to test.  There are optional command line arguments
that can be used to specify different parameters of the page
rank formula.  For a complete listing of command line arguments,
just run

	java -jar PageRank.jar -help

and it will print out the following usage document. 

		java -jar PageRank.jar -f [FILENAME]

		Optional Arguments
		
		-P [P Value]
			Set the value for P in the formula

		-i [Initial Rank Value]
			Set the initial rank value for each node in the graph

		-stop [Stop Value]
			Set the value that defines smallest change allowed between iterations

		-debug
			Enable printing of ranks of all nodes at the end of each iteration

		-help
			Print this help message

If you would like to run the PageRank simulation using the code you compiled, 
navigate to the src directory in my submission, and run the following command
in the command line

	java pagerank/PageRank -f inputfile.txt
	
This method is equivalent to running the Jar file I included.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Observing PageRank Output
---------------------------------------------------------------
The output of the PageRank program will be in the following format:

A    .570541
B    .570541
C    1.93265
D    3.57392

The first column is the node name.  The second column is the page
rank of the node as calculated by the program.  The nodes are not 
necessarily going to be in alphabetical/numberical order. They 
will be in order based on the order they were included in the input file.
